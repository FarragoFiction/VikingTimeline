plan on having ascii art in this folder, as well as gamefaq articles on different topics. 
keep articles short (300-600 pixels tall?)
articles will be run through the light player's quirk. 
at first, gamefaqs articles will be content locked. can't display ectobiology FAQ till it actually happens.
can't display frog FAQ until tier2 space quests are started, etc. etc.

Eventually, if I have enough of these, classes have preferences for which article they "write".
knights or whatever focus on combat. princes focus on the end game.
