Log 7. I think I managed to get more lost than I was before.

It’s cold, and the sun’s down. I’ve probably been wandering for days, whatever those mean anymore. It’s getting hard to even move, s’hard to walk, hard to think. I haven’t seen bird nor building recently, not even that weird little robot travelling around, just… snow. Nothing but snow. For miles and miles. This sickly white color, that’s all I've seen for a while. So I’ve been training my memory. Trying to jog out some details, trying to remember… anything, before all this. And, I dunno why,  I’ve been thinking a lot about death.

You die a lot in SBURB, and dying for the first time is… a very personal experience. You’re laying down, in what feels like a mantle of background pain, radiation itching from your skin. Your heart doesn’t stop in one go, most likely you’re bleeding out, so you hear your heartbeat like this primal drum inside you, and it plays as every bit of you leaks out. Your mind goes, goes, goes somewhere else as you brain starts shutting down in a desperate attempt to just live. Sight fades, taste dwindles, you stop smelling the stench of your own blood. But when everything is gone you start seeing.

There was this thing, this thing called life review. I looked it up after I ascended, and it’s… how do I explain it. The last part of your brain that dies is the one that holds your memories, right? All the things you REMEMBER that you found important. And your mind, it takes you through them, jumping from memory to memory, like it’s trying to stomp a bug, trying to stop it, trying everything it can. So in this frenzy you relive your memories, but… you feel what everyone else felt. Everything you’ve done that was good, you feel it, but also everyone you hurt, every insult you’ve thrown, every embarrassing thing you’ve said… you feel that. It’s purgatory, plain and simple. Divine punishment at its finest.

So maybe this is purgatory. This earth, I mean. Maybe I’ve died, and all I have for memories is just this featureless white, this visual static. This is just my punishment, it’s all I have, all I… deserve.

And maybe that’s worse than an eternity in hell.
