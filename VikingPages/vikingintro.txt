AH. EXCELLENT. I FORGOT THAT AB HAD HELPFULLY MADE THIS THING.

THIS IS MY JOURNAL. MY VIKING JOURNAL. IT HELPS ME TAKE NOTES. I USE IT TO WRITE DOWN THINGS I COULD FORGET.

EXCEPT. I NEVER FORGET ANYTHING. MY MEMORY IS CRYSTAL CLEAR. SIMPLY MAGNIFICENT. WHAT KIND OF DOLT WOULD FORGET THINGS? NOT ME. DEFINITELY NOT ME. ONLY GODLESS COWARDS FORGET THINGS.

HOWEVER. AB TOLD ME NOTING THINGS DOWN WOULD BE GOOD FOR 'PROGRESS-KEEPING.' THIS GOD IS VERY SMART. I THINK I WILL TAKE THE ADVICE.

THAT'S ALL I HAVE FOR TODAY. BUT I FEEL WEIRD LEAVING THE EMPTY SPACE. SO I'M STILL WRITING. I'M WORKING REALLY HARD ON THIS UNIVERSE. IT IS ALREADY SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE PREVIOUS ONE.

IT WILL BE BETTER. I'M SURE OF IT.
