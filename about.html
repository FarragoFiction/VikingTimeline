	   Hi!!! You have found the secret developer FAQ. I figure the stuff I wanted to ramble about that might be a bit too "techy" can go here, you know?
		 Also, don't mind how warped my fourth wall is, it gets like that whenever I stick it in a javascript comment. (hey, I wonder if this isn't the first time I've opened a
	 fourth wall into a javascript comment???)

		Q:  How the HELL does this pile of glitches even begin to work?
		A: You're going to want to START looking at "scene_controller.js" . That has a method called: "createScenesForSession".
				Each scene is in charge of knowing when it triggers, and what happens when it does trigger.  (this.trigger and this.content, respectively)
				A really straight forward scene to look at is "KingPowerful.js".  It triggers if the king is stronger than the hardcoded "hard strength",
				and displays a simple message about the game being hard.  The older a scene is in relation to the sim itself, the simpler the scene tends to be.
				I had this vague idea that scenes were gonna be hella simple and there would be a bunch of them. As the simulation matured, scenes got more and more complex
				(just look at how fucking huge "RelationshipDrama.js" is). This is because I started nesting triggers within scenes as I realized how fucking stupid it was to have,
				like, a hundred different javascript files in every html page I wanted to use the sim in. Shit is fucking untenable.

				In any case, scenes are where most of the intelligence lives. Players are repositories of stats, mostly. I remember reading that the Sims had most of the AI in the
				objects the Sims interacted with, and that seemed like a highly modable schema, so I took inspiration from it.  If I want something new to happen, I 'just' throw a new
				scene in.  And then weep deeply as shit goes buggy.

		Q: Why did you do <insert frankly baffling decision here>?
		A:  Shenanigans. No, really.  This simulation first started as something I threw together in a goddamned week. And then things just kept getting layered on top of each other.
				Design choices that made sense in week one would be an albatross around my neck by week 8, but only a few things were worth going to the effort of refactoring. And a decision that makes sense in week 8 is fucking ridiculous by week 16. It just keeps happening.
				I could take the time to do things 'right', or I can actually have fun making this sim and give you guys drops in a timely fashion.

				Something that might shed light on the situation is that my chatHandle is not just for show. I'm NOT a software developer, I'm a jaded motherfucking Researcher.
				Everything I program is designed to be a prototype, or help my team learn something. I.E. I make things that are designed to be used by a handful of people and then thrown away.
				This is the biggest thing I've ever made, with the biggest user base. I'm learning as I go, here.

		Q: How are you rendering the sprites?? It's not just layering pngs, is it?
		A: Nope, very astute of you hypothetical Observer.  If you dig around in my /images/Bodies/ folder, you will see that all of the bodies are colored as if they are Light players.
				This is because I am doing dynamic color replacement rather than having literally hundreds of differet sprites. It's WAY better to have 12 god tiers sprites that I just swap the colors out for.
				The same engine allows me to have troll wings match their blood colors, and hair color match blood/aspect color as well.

				~~~~Okay, time for the super technical shit:~~~~~

				Here's where my actual fucking day job came in handy.  HTML5's canvas allows you to access the actual byte array for any images drawn onto it.
				So, instead of having it being encoded into an image format, like PNG or JPG or whatever, it's just straight up RGBA values.
				Imagine you have a png that's 10 wide and 10 tall (it's a very shitty png).  Once you've drawn it onto the HTML5 canvas, you can use
				the canvas' context's built in function "getImageData" to get an array of bytes out.
				The array will be 400 long, or 10 wide x 10 tall x 4 bytes per pixel.

				There are 4 bytes per pixel because there is 1 byte per color.  Red is one byte, green is one byte, blue is one byte, and alpha is one byte.
				When I say "byte", I could also say "0-255" or 0x00- 0xFF.  When you're talking about HTML colors, you might say #ff00ff, which is the same thing as saying
				[255,0,255,255] as a byte array (regular html font colors always have max alpha, so that last 255 in the array is the assumed max alpha).

				So, if I had a red pixel, and then a green pixel and then a blue pixel, and then a clear pixel, I would expect the array to look like:
				[255,0,0,255,0,255,0,255,0,0,255,255,0,0,0,0];  Which makes even me go crosseyed and I'm the one who wrote it. But, like, see how there are 4 pixels and 16 things in the array?

				So, check out "swapColors" in  "handle_sprites.js".
				In human words, what's going on is: "Take in two html hex values, like #00ff00 or #ff0000. Turn those into byte arrays like [0,255,0] or [255,0,0].
				Get the image data out of the canvas, and loop through it pixel by pixel (which is 4 bytes at a time).
				For each pixel, check to see if it's bytes match the bytes I'm looking for (and that the alpha is maxed).
				If it is, change the bytes to be the bytes I want them to be.  Write the modified image back to the context when you're done."

		Q:  How are the PesterChum dialogue things handled?

		A:  Scenes/Intro.js is a good example of how the dialogue works.  First, the scene itself knows whether or not there is dialogue in it. The scene will create an entire dialogue all as a single string, using a helper method called
		"chatLine" which is kept in scene_controller.js.  Once all the lines are done, it calls "drawChat", in handle_sprites.js.

		drawChat is reponsible for rendering the players, and rendering the text as lines (seperated by 'new lines' or \n characters) colored in the players' font color. It does this by checking for the players chatHandleInitials at the start of a line.

		So, a raw chat might look like:

		AB: Is this REALLY how you want to explain your dialogue system?\nJB:I guess so!!! Can you think of a better way?\nAB:Maybe it's finally time to update the dialogue engine.\nJR:Fuck. After 3.0.\n

		But then the drawChat makes it all nice and multiline and colorful and shit.

		Also: AB DOES have a point (as always), the dialogue engine is hella out of date and has been unchanged since 2.0 went live. I'll probably update it at some point.

	<br><Br>
		<li><b>What the hell is this?</b><br><Br>
			THIS IS MY MASTERPIECE. IT INVOLVES BATTLE. ROMANCE. MORE BATTLE. BUT ALSO, VIKINGS. IT IS ULTIMATELY BETTER THAN WHATEVER PUNY SHIT YOU WERE PLAYING BEFORE.

<li><b>Why have a Patreon?</b><br><Br>
YOU MISSPELLED IT AGAIN, PUNY MORTAL. PATRONS ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY CAN KEEP YOU SAFE FROM EVIL. JUST LOOK AT NI̕D̥̹HO͔͍̫͔̯̩̫G̭̖G̱͝.̪͎̥̻͙̤͜

	<li> <b>Do I have to know how to hack to get that password?</b><br><br>
			  NO. BUT YES. I'M THE ONLY HACKER HERE. YOU CAN DO IT. I BELIEVE NO ONE SHOULD BE STOPPED BY THE UNIVERSE FROM HACKING. BUT I WILL ALSO FUCKING KILL YOU. KEEP THAT IN MIND.
	</li>
	<br><Br>

	<li> <b>Is there a way to save/share my session?</b><br><br>
			FINALLY. A RELEVANT QUESTION. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS CLICK QUOTE, SHAREABLE URL, UNQUOTE. IT WILL GIVE YOU A LINK WITH A SEED. IF THAT DOES NOT WORK, TRY PRINTING FROM PDF. WHATEVER THAT MEANS.

	<li> <b>The simulation isn't working!</b><Br><br>

		  GOOD. IT MEANS THE GLORIOUS BATTLE IS WORKING.

<br><br>
	<li> <b>No, I mean I think you broke the sim. For, like, everybody. </b>
			<br><Br> OH. UH... SORRY.
		<BR><BR> BUT. ALSO NOT, YOU VERMIN. I KNOW IF SOMETHING IS BROKEN. NOT YOU. ME. UNDERSTOOD? I AM THE SMART ONE HERE. I MAKE THINGS WORK. YOU KNOW. NOTHING.	</li>

	<br><Br>
	<li><b>Can you add names for the players? It's hard to keep track of everybody!</b><br><Br>
		NO. MORTALS DON'T DESERVE NAMES. MORTALS DON'T DESERVE ANYWAY. I'M THE ONLY ONE WITH A NAME. I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO MATTERS.
	</li>
	<br><Br>
	<li> <b>Did you make all those images yourself?</b><br><br>
			Dammit, Jim, I'm a programmer, not an artist. Wait. What was the question? Oh, right.  No, I'm not a particularly artistic person. This causes no end of frustration for karmicRetribution, the SBURBSim Artist.  They have transformed this site into the visual spectacular that it is, massaging existing art assets (vague source list here: <a href ="sources">here</a>) into something usable, creating new art assets and just generally protecting Good Design from my callow disregard. c3<
			<Br><Br> KR also bugs and fusses and meddles until I agree to update the CSS or move a character 10 pixels to the left or whatever thing I didn't even notice but was driving them crazy. <div class = "void">KR will be all 'Why are all the characters clipping off the left edge!?' and I will be 'I dunno...Looks like PastJR decided to render them to -100x ???', and then KR will be all: 'WHY would you do that!? Fix it! It's driving me crazy!' and I'll shrug and not get it but put that am all at 0 like a sane person and then holy fuck it DOES look better.  And then it'll turn out that PastJR totally had a very excellent (but lazy) REASON for doing that and now there are bugs everywhere, but it DOES look better, so I'll just buckle down and code shit right this time AND keep the visual upgrade. And that is the story of how the sprites got moved like 100 pixels over. </div>
