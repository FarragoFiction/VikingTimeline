So have you ever gotten interested in a friend's project, and then thought "Oh look, there's a small thing I can help them with! It should only take a few minutes, even!" And a few weeks later you found yourself using all of your spare time to work on the project?
<p>
Yeah.
<p>
Anyway, I'm karmicRetribution, Smith of <a href="http://archiveofourown.org/works/340777/chapters/644389">Dream</a> (because this project is <em>all</em> about self-indulgent OC antics), and I put together the vast majority of the images for the <a href="index2.html">Sburb Story Generator</a> and <a href="oc_generator.html">OC Generator</a>. See <a href="sources">here</a> for a list of sources for sprites, etc. Sprites have been re-sized, re-colored, and occasionally entirely redrawn so that they could be pulled apart into individual pieces and fed to the rendering engine. A couple of things I drew from scratch, like the human babies.

If you want to contact me, just send your message to jadedResearcher@yahoo.com and let her know you have a question/comment/rude remark for karmicRetribution. It'll get to me.
