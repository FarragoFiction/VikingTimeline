Soon, his thoughts became malicious, and he wanted to kill and rob other people, so he started raiding sessions. He attacks using briefcases, and he and his fellow employees can use “Steam Sales”, which rains Steam Sales. The Ultimate Sale Thief can use a powerful version, “Tsunami of Sales”. He whacks people with his briefcase, and his guards use spears. He can be defeated if you beat him and his 2 guards in strife, and rob him.

{"bbName":"Yaish Notail","jrComment":"good defeat conditions, solid ai in general.","entrantName":"deathlyHealer","imagesCSV":"imagesCSV","text":"HISTORY: -<br>Legend goes that the Yaish Botail was once a SBURB player from an alien race; a Witch of Void from a session of forty-two players. Many self-described SBURB experts have claimed that every error that occurred in this session can be traced back to its abundance of players. The most notable of these errors is that, of the forty-two players, only seven had classpects. Much of the happenings in the Yaish Botail’s session is unknown, however it has been noted that the Yaish Botail, perhaps upon God-Tiering, was responsible for its session’s destruction. Corrupted by forces unknown, the Yaish Botail transformed into a mindless entity with just one goal – To bring all of existence back to its natural state. Empty.-<br>DESCRIPTION:-<br>It is unknown what the Yaish Botail looked like prior to transformation, due to the records of its long-dead species being destroyed. Post-transformation, the Yaish Botail has been ‘spotted’ by few who have lived long enough to escape their session and tell the tale. Those who have describe it as “an intangible mass of frigid air and feelings of impending doom”. The presence of the Yaish Botail causes everything around you to look as if you were seeing it through water. Shortly after that, everything will begin to fade away, as the Yaish Botail consumes everything in sight.-<br>GOALS:-<br>The Yaish Botail desires everything to return to nothing. It does this passively, simply erasing everything it touches from existence as it glides aimlessly from session to session. It has been noted that Derse and Prospit are usually the first to meet their demise via the Yaish Botail. After that, each player planet in the order the players entered. The Yaish Botail also seems to affect Void players, specifically Witches, Seers, Sylphs and Bards, causing them to go Grimdark to aid the Yaish Botail in its quest for destruction.-<br>❤2-<br>LIKES:-<br>The Yaish Botail has not been observed to be sentient enough to ‘like’ anything. It does appear to be drawn to certain Void players though, if only briefly, to turn them Grimdark.-<br>DISLIKES:-<br>In each session it destroys, the Yaish Botail appears to leave Mind and Light players and their planets for last, almost as if building up its energy before combat. It has been theorised that the Yaish Botail dislikes, as much as it can dislike anything, mind and light players due to them being the only ones capable of potentially driving it out of a session.-<br>DEFEAT CONDITIONS:-<br>There have been only two known instances of the Yaish Botail being driven out of a session. The first was a session containing a God-Tiered Grace of Mind. The Grace claims to not know what it did to get the Yaish Botail to leave, however two fraymotifs and a lot of screaming were apparently involved. The other instance was with a Grimdark Seer of Light. It appeared that the Seer simply being there was enough to drive the Yaish Botail away.-<br>","shogunComment":"shogunComment"}

Since the session was void, though, it seemed like the Necromancer would have been limited to just his doomed session, but since magic is total nonsense, he was able to randomly teleport to other sessions on-demand, so basically, nobody's safe from this thing.-<br>","shogunComment":"shogunComment"}

How much of an effect it has depends on how close they are to the one it's hidden in (as dictated by Observatory coords).  At the edges of its influence, there may be just one or two minor things that are \"off\" about the session.  Maybe it's a non-black-haired troll or a non-red-blooded human, maybe someone starts off as a robot.  Maybe there's Void and/or Rage shenanigans without there even being a player of either aspect.  Closer in, the effect becomes more apparent, with a few players having more blatant shows of something messing with the session, from fanon classpects in non-everythingFuckingGoes sessions, players with Null in their title, basically anything that could result from someone fucking with the character creator.  In middling conditions, you'll start seeing not only characters that don't belong when using codes that alter the characters (non-Wastes in wasteStuck, non-Nepetas in nepeta=:33, non-canon in rumpus=fruity), but also premade characters in non selfInsertOC sessions.  This will usually be commented on by the Session with a \"Wait, don't I know this guy?\" or something similar.  No Metaplayers, though.  Not yet. <br><br>(This is incredibly inconvenient.)<br><br>Continue on, and you'll find 13+-player sessions, sessions that combine with themselves, and instances of Gnosis of greater and greater magnitudes.  On top of that, characters who shouldn't be players (like the Carapacians, the Consorts, or even the royalty) might end up getting their hands on copies of SBURB/SGRUB, gaining a Land, a Title, and a Quest.  Getting to around ten sessions away, it'll start directly influencing the session, with bullshit and nonsense piling up to the point where it can directly infect characters.  They'll become Errors themselves, inverted in color and going out of their way to cause chaos.  This also immediately grants them Player status if they don't already have it.  In sessions three away or closer, it'll infect Skaia itself.  This makes it actively try to get the frog bred, and lash out against anyone who tries to interfere.  Once the frog is bred, the Ȩ͢҉̷̞͜Ŕ̡̯R̸͞͞O̴͘͢R̖̀̕ will be in control, initiating what is basically a harder P̼͘͝ư̡̧r̴̨͝҉̯̞̱p̸̀͢l҉͙͠͝ȩ̷͝ ̶͓̀F͚̕̕r̰͍͝o̴̢͡g͢͝҉̢͇́ fight.  Defeating the Ȩ̨͍R̶̨͡Ŗ҉̠̳̝O͏͜͜Ŕ̶҉͈͇͇ ̴̹͢F̷̴̼Ŕ̀͡O̷̧͢G̶̰͢ results in a special epilogue involving a large multiverse.<br><br>The final level of corruption is, obviously, when the session with the Ȩ͢҉̷̞͜Ŕ̡̯R̸͞͞O̴͘͢R̖̀̕ actually in it is reached.  It manifests itself as a glitched version of one of the players in the session, along with Skaia and most of both Dream Moons being infected, including some of the dreamselves.  The players have to cooperate with the remaining, uncorrupted Carapacians to take down the Ȩ͢҉̷̞͜Ŕ̡̯R̸͞͞O̴͘͢R̖̀̕ and its army.  The Ȩ͢҉̷̞͜Ŕ̡̯R̸͞͞O̴͘͢R̖̀̕ will breed the frog itself, intent on creating and infecting a Pink Frog, using its perfection to spread further and cause total chaos.  The resistance will have to fight the Ȩ͢҉̷̞͜Ŕ̡̯R̸͞͞O̴͘͢R̖̀̕ after completing their quests, which is easier said than done even with all the bullshit boosts some of them may have gotten.<br><br>If it's defeated before the frog is bred, the players get to keep its notes and breed the Pink Frog.  If it succeeds in making the U̴͢͠L̸̢͞T̪̳͜Į̧̮M̬͢͞A̶͞͏T̢͘҉̛̝͔E̷̕͡ ̷̝͝E̡͘҉̲̦͎R̢̡͞Ŗ́͟Ǫ̜͠Ŗ̸́ ́́͡F̸̡̛Ŗ̴͟O҉̢͢͞G̵̡̨, on the other hand, it's a huge fight, with all players from the Easter Egg sessions (plus five others) in God Tier form coming in to face it, as the creation of the U̴͢͠L̸̢͞T̪̳͜Į̧̮M̬͢͞A̶͞͏T̢͘҉̛̝͔E̷̕͡ ̷̝͝E̡͘҉̲̦͎R̢̡͞Ŗ́͟Ǫ̜͠Ŗ̸́ ́́͡F̸̡̛Ŗ̴͟O҉̢͢͞G̵̡̨ corrupts all players from the actual session.  If the players win, the Ȩ͢҉̷̞͜Ŕ̡̯R̸͞͞O̴͘͢R̖̀̕ retreats.  All players are back to normal, although the ones killed in the fight stay dead.  Everyone enters the frog and all is well.

The first member of the hive mind, only known as HIM, was a Lord of Blood whose matesprite was a Maid of Time. During their session, he found out that she was cheating on him with the session's space player, as she had became close with her during their time breeding frogs together. Filled with a mix of sadness and anger, he fled into the void of the furthest ring. There, his mind was corrupted by a horrorterror. This caused him to despise every passive class in existence. <br><br>- Any session can be targeted, but it has a higher chance if It has a big amount of passive classes, and a EVEN BIGGER CHANCE if one (or more) of the players are maids.<br><br>- The boys will target both passive and active classes, but in different ways. For passive classes (such as seers, maids, and bards), they will pretend to like the player. Then, when they are caught off guard, they will slay them. For active classes, the boys will befriend, and eventually get the player to join their cause. They win when all the passive classes are dead and/or all of the active classes join their cause.
