In reality, VI is the leftover code from an unused carapace, damaged by countless sessions crashing or otherwise falling apart. Now self-aware, he seeks escape into a newly born universe, presumably to rule with an iron fist. He accomplishes this by getting players to hack SBURB in such a way he ends up with more power.-<br>VI cannot be directly fought. He has no hitboxes in the half-finished mess he calls a codebase. Conversely, he has no means of attack either. He wins by getting the players to break SBURB with Gnosis bullshit to the point he can escape. He is defeated when the players all reject his “help” and play the session normally, causing him to leave in search of a session that will help him. Alternatively, finishing the session in any way without allowing him to leave will also defeat him, though it’s a bit hollow unless the frog gets finished as well.-<br>In general, when the “Helpful Coplayer” arrives, he will get in contact with the players of the session, trying to convince them to make Gnosis progress. Players may agree to help him, or catch on to his ruse and oppose him. This causes 2 factions to form among the players, VI’s allies and his opponents. VI will try and convince his allies to get rid of opposing players, either by converting them to his side or, if he has enough loyalty from his allies, killing them outright. His opponents will either work on finishing the game, or try and convince the other players to turn their back on VI. They generally avoid killing if they can help it. Each Gnosis 4 event grants him a new power based on the aspect. Usually sets himself opposed to any other big bads that show up as a show of goodwill to the players of a session, but may help them in secret if they also cause gnosis.-<br>Likes: Wastes, Graces (predisposed to Gnosis anyway, easy targets), the gullible, anyone with Gnosis before he enters, Void Players (he seems to do really well for himself when Void 4 hits)-<br>Dislikes: Heart or Mind players, Seer players (Easy time seeing through his lies), Murder Mode (risk of killing his helpers), Grimdark (Crashing fucks him up bad)-<br>VI has no fixed appearance; no model for him was ever finished. He instead appears as a random God Tier of the species most common in the session. He is always recognizable by the pesterchum initials VI and his distinctive “glitchy audio” quirk-<br>VI: He stu-stu-stutters the fir-fir-first 3 let-let-letters in eve-eve-every other wor-wor-word.","shogunComment":"shogunComment"}
