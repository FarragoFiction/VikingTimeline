{"bbName":"The Cone","jrComment": " good use of the jr metric. i approve. maybe he's triggered by a wasted player? i guess he does nothing if there are no players he wants to kill. seems easy enough ","entrantName":"THE LAW","imagesCSV":"imagesCSV","text":"Description: The Cone appears as a humanoid figure, around 1.5 JRs tall, in a fully black suit. He is often seen holding his double-handed HALTSTAFF, and occasionally a pair of scales, although only when on a player's land, and outside of combat. The scales are a very rare part of the Cone's choice of \"weapons\",  and are often seen mostly against life players, princes, or murder mode players. Alongside all this, the Cone possesses his CONE OF TRUTH upon his head, completely covering his face. This is just a normal, slightly damaged traffic cone. If this is his head or just a cool hat is unknown, as he will immediately smack anyone who attempts to touch it. <br><br><br><br>Conditions: The Cone is summoned to a session that has experienced high rates of unnatural activity, or anything that would normally hinder a regular session's progression. If a player goes Murder Mode, the Cone has a slightly higher chance of appearing, and can often be encountered in a session experiencing a gnosis of any tier below 4. If a crowned carapace is defeated by the players, he may also appear, but with a lower chance of actually interacting with the players beyond his appearance. <br><br><br><br>Likes: Order, Successful Sessions, Doom Players, Decent People, Auspistice Relationships, Justice<br><br><br><br>Dislikes: Failed Sessions, Gnosis, Murder Mode, Crowned Carapaces, Chaotic Situations<br><br><br><br>Goal: If the Cone appears in a session, he will immediately search out any players currently causing \"problems\", starting gnosis, or going murder mode. If the Cone comes into contact with any of these, he will immediately attempt a fight with them. Upon victory, the Cone will kill  murder modes, while just ignoring other defeated players. Alongside this, he will also target anything disrupting the session. He'll visit a space player's land to check the frog, and target any crowned carapaces that may be causing trouble with the players.<br><br>Defeat Conditions: The Cone will eventually lose interest in a session that has experienced nothing negative or unnatural for a usual session. After all murder mode, gnosis, or disruptive players/carapaces have been defeated by the cone (or are no longer any of these things), he will leave the session, allowing players to continue on. <br><br><br><br>Despite his overall helpful influence on sessions, it is unknown exactly why the Cone does what he does, or who he is. One thing is for certain: he is not a human or troll, but something else entirely. He can't have been a dead session player, as he possesses no Sburb-based abilities. The Cone has no eyes, yet he judges all. The Cone has no mouth, but his word is law. He is multiversal constant, stepping in to save a session by cutting off the head of whatever may hinder it. <br><br>The main theory of the Cone's existence is that he is a physical, human-shaped representation of the hidden aspect of Law. While this is most likely true, there would be no way to tell unless the Cone comes into contact with player of this aspect. And you don't see many of those around, do you?","shogunComment":"shogunComment"}

{"bbName":"Zingo The Clown","entrantName":"Queen-Aramun","imagesCSV":"","text":"- No one knows where this strange comedian came from. Some say he always existed, long before there were gods or even a universe. Others say he's their strange uncle  Carl who believes he’s some ancient guardian clown angel. No matter the case, the Clown is a force to be reckoned with, who will pull all sorts of nonsensical horse shit out of his jester bag of tricks. <br><br>- The Clown’s main goal is to purge the world of unclean clowns, and serious business. For some godforsaken reason he wants to prevent exit from the ultimate entertainment and game: Sburb.<br><br>- He has a chance of being summoned if a Bard with an interest in comedy besmirches the clown name by going grimdark. <br><br>- While he is in a session, he will do anything in his power to cause players to flip the fuck out, and also likes to steal the rings of x-fold for some reason? Clowns are weird like that.<br><br>- Likes: Stealing the rings, comedy, CD, Shrimp as food, Shenanigans, flipping the fuck out, bards<br><br>- Dislikes: Grimdark Players, Gnosis, Shrimp as animals, High Sburb Lore, Clowns with terrible interests, Robots, Space players, Doom players, Serious things in general.<br><br><br><br>Defeat Conditions: Despite his large amount of health, he can be defeated if he takes enough damage, but if a player who is extremely serious (EX: A grimdark player, or a player with a high sburb lore stat) challenges him, he'll run away in fear.<br><br><br><br>(Note: Don't ask about his fixation with shrimp, otherwise he'll get extra rowdy if you do. He's raiding my kitchen. I don't know where my grandfather is and I don't have a phone.

Oh....THATS why TG mentioned 'word in name', so BBs can target each other. This guy clearly needs to want to murder the Pistol Shrimp.","shogunComment":""}
