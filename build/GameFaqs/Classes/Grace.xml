            Question: My consorts are calling me the Grace. What's that about?

            Well... There isn't a lot of information about what Graces can do. Most sessions with a Grace just... lose contact after a while. Maybe you can write a FAQ yourself and help everyone else figure out why.

            It seems that I have rolled Grace. What should I do?

            Probably tell others to take a peek at the code. What could possibly go wrong?
