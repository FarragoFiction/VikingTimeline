            What even are Guides? I've never heard of those.

            Guides are all about showing others their aspects while also protecting them from the dangers of it.

            There are from two to twelve lands in your session - maybe even more - and your team is already claiming they've seen it all? They are liars. Grab them and drag to a hiking trip. It's fun!
