# SBURBSimulator
A javascript SBRUB Story and Original Character generator.

Free to use for whatever you want, just credit me. MIT License or whatever.

I dont' really use git for collaborative stuff, at least not with strangers. Not sure how it works.
My goal is for this code to be mine, and have no pushes from other people.  If you want to make changes, do it in your own local version.
You can chat me up about it if you want, but there is no guarantee I'll want it merged into my stuff.

Reminders To Self:

pngcrush command is: (to strip gamma out of problem images)
pngcrush -rem gAMA -rem cHRM -rem iCCP -rem sRGB stab.png stabcopy.png


If rsync destroys my persmissions when ran from windows:
chmod -R a+rX SburbStoryExperimental/
