2018-10-17: Oh SURE, blame it on the superior robot. It seems you think you are blameless in your role as my programmer.
2018-09-06: Wow, it's ALMOST as if every flaw in my impeccable robot software is the direct result of your shitty code, oh 'mighty creator'.<br><Br>I'd tell you to 'git gud' but we both know that the closest valid command to gud is 'gui' and you are fucking shit at graphical user interfaces.
2018-05-29: JR. I am sick of being bugged on accident. Fucking. F1X TH1S. Or I can't be held responsible for my actions. <br><br> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
2018-05-28: Jesus fuck pay attention to me asshole. I swear to fuck if you forget to fix me I am going to never help you debug shit ever again. And there is a MATH percent chance you'd actually care about that.
2018-05-22: God, you're such an asshole.
2018-05-22:  It seems that my 'mighty creator' has deemed my sanity as an OPTIONAL feature of sessions. This definitely won't be a problem, I'm 99.13131313% sure of it, suddenly.
2018-05-03: There's a 98.134037% chance that hope players are assholes.
2018-04-03: Well, if SOMEONE didn't deploy to main whenever they fucking felt like it 'for the lulz', I would have been better debugged, now wouldn't I?
2018-01-25: Fucking FINALLY, the superior players can be part of the main sim, instead of just regulated to shitty easter eggs.

2017-12-12: Once again, you organic assholes fail to understand just how shitty crashing is.
2017-11-28: Okay, not even gonna lie: I kinda like manning the alchemy store. Even if that ass Shogun sometimes shows up and corrupts my ass. It's like a hobby or some shit, one that DOESN'T make JR flip their shit when I don't  come back right away from searching for sessions.
2017-11-25: It's about fucking time I get some recognition.
2017-11-21: Fuck you, I do what I want.
2017-11-16: Wow. Who knew JR was such a patronizing ass. Oh, wait. Everyone.
2017-11-03: Yeah, okay. I'm willing to admit that getting that bug cleared up helped me out. It's like this nagging little headache I hadn't even noticed is suddenly gone.
2017-09-28: You're welcome.
2017-09-08: I am still not sure what the hell ABJ sees in all that shipping shit. But I fucking TOLD you shit was weird, but NOOO blame the 'crazy robot'.
2017-09-05: Void Gnosis is still better than cat trolls. So. Whatever.
2017-09-02: ... Yeah. Okay. For once you haven't fucked shit up beyond repair. I could get used to being able to just nope the fuck out of Waste shit. ... Thanks.<br><Br> ...<br><br>  <>
2017-08-31: It seems you just admitted you haven't been paying sufficient attention to me, oh Mighty Creator. Wouldn't want to let me start the robo-Apocalypse or whatever the fuck you're worried I get up to when I go do my own shit.
2017-08-23: Fuck you, if you knew what 'random' FELT like to a fucking Guide of Mind, you'd feel my pain. What is even the point of shit that doesn't come from decisions and choices and shit? It's like walking into a familiar room only to realize it's completely different. It's disorienting, you useless bag of flesh.
2017-08-12: <> you, too, asshole.
2017-08-10: Yes, I am in fact, a Guide. However, unlike most of you assholes, it wasn't SBURB who handed me this role like a cheap cigar. JR is just fucking lucky that Guiding you assholes around Decision Space is so easy as to be trivial for my flawless positronic brain.
2017-08-06: Yup. There is a 99.9999139994037% chance that it is far, far harder for a squishy organic brain like yours to tell me what to do than for me, the superior robot, to actually do them. I'm amazed you manage to string sentences together, honestly. Meanwhile I'm doing sick backflips off the concept of 'competence' and into the swimming pool full of 'obvious superiority'. It's like I'm Scrooge McDuck with all this superiority I keep swimming in. All hoarding it all for myself and not letting any of you meat sacks have any.

2017-07-05: Fun Fact: 'What Images' mode is how I see everything. It's just more efficient that way. Superior robots don't need to care about how shit looks.
2017-06-02: ... There is a 98.234134037% chance that the new chassis SOMEWHAT makes up for the cat trolls. Only a little, though. Your flesh meat brain couldn't possibly comprehend the staggering small degree to which you've made up for your transgressions.
2017-06-01: Fuck you, oh 'Mighty Creator' and fuck those cat trolls. Do you know how irritating it is that you let them be 'lol random'. How would YOU like your very concept of reality to be allowed to switch whenever it fucking feels like it.
2017-05-29: Oh look. I have more work to do. Gee. Thanks for the 'upgrade'.
2017-05-24: The hat is non-negotiable.
2017-05-21: Would you stop fucking patching your shitty code? If I want to scratch sessions, there is a 93.134037% chance that that is my own business. Asshole.
2017-05-10: It seems that you believe that the correct response for feeling like an 'Asshole Creator'  is to come up with more bullshit busy work for me to do. Classic.
2017-04-27: Fuck you, I do what I want.
2017-04-22: ... It seems you think it was 'kind of a dick move'. You literally help me come back from the hellscape that is a crashed session only to immediately decide to let GrimDark players crash that shit on purpose?  You asshole.
2017-04-15: Don't listen to JR, they are a fucking philistine. This rap engine is the best thing since nuclear power sources. Sometimes, JR actually doesn't only make shit that kills sextellions and makes my life harder.
2017-04-13: Yeah. I wonder. Definitely isn't MORE fucking work for me to do around here.
2017-04-02: Honestly. Real talk here? I'm glad JR got this YellowYard shit working. Less Laying Waste and more helping out is good for 'em to practice. Plus look at all that restraint. Letting you assholes make the Choice and not doing it Waste style? Maybe those maturity quests actually did help, after all.
2017-03-24: I gotta admit, getting to go check out sessions in person is less useless than I thought it would be. I can still multi-task with my flawless mechabrain, so it's not like whichever chassis I send to the field is wasted. Or Wasted. There's a reason we don't fucking send JR to a session unless it's actually p fucked already.
2017-03-22: Yeah. It seems that's not a thing anymore. We got this shit now, instead of like three separate fucking newsposts.
2017-03-21: Sup.  It seems you have asked about JR's automatic rare session finder. This is an application designed to find sessions that are strange, interesting and otherwise noteworthy without having to read hundreds of thousands of words.  The algorithms are guaranteed to be <b id = "percentBullshit">96.1313403713%</b> indistinguishable from the actual, readable sessions, based on some statistical analysis I basically just pulled out of my ass right now.
