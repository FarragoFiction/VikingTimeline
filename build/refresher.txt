Key Points:
Homestuck is about a game called SBURB/SGRUB/WHATEVER
SBURB wipes out your species. There is no way to prevent or undo this.
SBURB lets you attempt to be the Gods of an  entirely new Universe.
SBURB is a buggy piece of shit and most people who play it die pointlessly.
SBURB is wildly ambitious (see buggy piece of shit) and includes 144 unique character types and time travel and paradoxes and all sorts of shit.
Most of the character types have both a traditional role (like what they do in game) and a narrative role. Light players, for example, are in charge of being lucky as well as providing exposition.
SBURB has an afterlife mechanic where even if you "come back to life" using a back up life mechanic, you still left a ghost in the afterlife and that's still a tragedy.

So the big thing about Homestuck is that the whole SETTING (not the plot, technically) of it is a bunch of friends playing a game. The game is not a normal game, and they are not the only people playing this game. The game has many names, but is always called something dumb like SBURB or SGRUB or something. Homestuck is about a few different ways the game can go, but it hints that there is far more ways things can happen.    The fandom has turned this into a vast roleplaying system, as you might expect.

SBURB is a buggy, buggy game. Most sessions of it end in abject failure.

SBURB is a multiplayer game. It comes on a Client Disk, and a Server Disk. Players are expected to daisy chain, with your server becoming the client of a third player, who becomes the client of a fourth player and so on, until it wraps around and you become the server of the final player.

Shortly after installing the game, your species will go extinct.(There is no way to stop or undo this). Your first task is to escape your Universe and enter "The Medium" via stupid game mechanics. If you don't do this, you die with the rest of your species (usually through a meteor storm that SBURB teleports into your solar system). You are required to cooperate with your Server player to release a "sprite" and then throw a personal item into it. This personal item is generally something that was once alive (like the ashes of a dead relative or a taxidermied pet) or that is symbolically alive (like a doll). If you try to throw something "wrong" into it, the sprite will dodge.  What you throw into the sprite decides what form the enemies in the Medium will take.

Once you have done that and solved a puzzle, you and your house are transported to the Medium, where you fight low level enemies based on your sprite and explore a weird fantasy area. It is gradually revealed to be an entire small planet. With a seemingly random name like the Land of Frost and Frogs or the Land of Wind and Shade, generally abbreviated as LOFAF or LOWAS.  Your Server player eventually enters as well, and has their own planet, with it's own name.  Your planet is host to NPCs called consorts that are generally some type of anthropomorphic reptile or amphibian and are kind of dumb. They are waiting for a Hero to come and save their planet and clearly have no idea that it's obviously you. The Hero has a bullshit randomly generated Title like the Heir of Breath or the Knight of Time.  The Consorts are being menaced by a Denizen and the Hero is prophesied to defeat them. The Denizen has a generically mythological name like Hephaestus or Nyx.

At this point the game opens up and players figure out how to use Gates to teleport to each other's Lands (which are arranged like a solar system) and do quests together and unlock game powers and what not. If everything went right (it never does), they'd do the Consort's quests, figure out how to defeat their personal Denizen and then move on to the End Game as a team.

The End Game of SBURB happens when the Reckoning occurs. While everybody is doing their RPG quests and what not, at the center of the lands is Skaia, where a massive battle rages, White (Prospit) vs Black (Derse). Black is fated to defeat White. When that finally happens (might take a day, might take months), a meteor storm will descend to destroy Skaia. The Players must rush to Skiaia to defeat the Black King before Skiaia is destroyed. The players also have to have performed the Ultimate Alchemy before Skaia is destroyed, or they lose the game and are trapped in the medium forever.  Skaia will attempt to buy them time by teleporting the meteors away (and also back in time, mostly to the players home planet back when their species was wiped out). Did I mention that SBURB has time powers?  Several of the meteors go further back in time however, and are revealed to be carrying the baby versions of the players on them. Thus, everything is a weird stable time paradox.  SBURB was always going to destroy your species because you existed in the first place.


SBURB has extremely strict time travel rules. There is a single timeline that is "fated" or "alpha". Time players (like the Knight of Time I mentioned before) have the ability to change time all they want. Phenomenal cosmic power. BUT,  something that is no longer from the fated time line is destroyed.  So, a Time player can watch all their friends die and decided to go back in time to try to prevent it, but at the cost of their own life. They usually have a little bit of time before they die, so they tend to time travel to boss fights to help the party out in a suicide rush. Whole timelines can become doomed as well , especially if it causes a paradox that isn't "allowed". Examples of doomed timelines would be the first player in the game dying before they can become the server player for the last player to get in.  Or the player destined to do the sciency-stuff that creates all their baby selves dies before doing that, so none of them were ever born. Or, a timeline would be doomed if the players tried to make it so the White side did not lose (if that happened, the meteor storm wouldn't happen, so their baby selves wouldn't ride meteors back in time to their home planets and so time paradox).

SBURB kills most of it's players. Each player has a free back up life called a "Dream Self".  This is an extra body.  Players will be able to use this body while sleeping. Some players can access it even before they install the game, while others won't be able to use it even after beating the game.  The Dream Self has a room on either the Black (Derse) or the White (Prospit) capital Moon. While using the body you can do Moon quests.  Should your main body die AND another player get to it in time, they can kiss the body (like a fairy tale) and your Dream Self will be designated as your main body. If nobody does it in time your Dream Self will slowly gain the wounds your real self has and die as well.   Each body is considered to be a separate person. Even if you are "revived" via corpse smooch, your real body gets a ghost in the Afterlife, and can be revived later via several in game mechanisms (thus there will be two of you running around). This was especially tragic in Homestuck.    Certain player types (such as a Witch of Life) are capable of manipulating the Afterlife such that players without dreamselves are allowed to "dream" in the afterlife with their ghosts even while alive. SBURB has such a bullshit array of different powers.

Dream Selves are ALSO the fuel for the "God Tier" mechanic. If  Real Self dies on a Quest Bed or a Dream Self dies on a Sacrificial Slab, the Dream Self is converted into a GodTier.  GodTier's have weird pajamas whose shape is based on the class (like Knight) and whose color is based on the aspect (like Time).   GodTier's are given conditional Immortality and greater power.  They are no longer allowed to die for pointless reasons (pointless reasons being surprisingly common in SBURB).  If what they died of is sufficiently dramatic (labeled as "Heroic" or "Just" for being roughly good or evil deaths), then it is permanent, otherwise they dramatically revive with a rainbow glow after a few minutes.

The Ultimate Alchemy is also known as Frog Breeding. This is so you can have the visual metaphor of having a massive fucking tadpole swim up to the center of a solar system looking thing and impregnate the sun/skiaia and make a new universe that way. Whatever.  The Space player  (like a X or Space) is in charge of Frog breeding. There will ALWAYS be a Space and Time player in a SBURB session, or it is automatically doomed.  If the Space player isn't distracted/dead and does their job, once the Black King is destroyed, they deploy the frog, it impregnates Skiaia, a giant frog is born and becomes a Universe, the players enter the Universe as gods, the end.

If the space player DIDN'T do their job (which is common), and there is no frog, then the players are trapped in a failed session, forever. SBURB expects failure to be common, however, and provides a single "New Game Plus" mechanism.  The Time player's Land has a "Scratch" mechanism, which allows Skiaia to remix (like a record scratching with rapping) how the players were distributed when it sent them back in time.  Specifically, at the same time it created the players, it ALSO created their guardians (generally their parents) and sent them even further back in time.  When a Scratch happens, it swaps them, so the players are now the adults and their former parents/grandparents/etc are now the kids who are playing the game. The new players are given stat bonuses and extra gear and allowed to try again. You cannot scratch a second time if you fail.

Additionally, the Space player can do a shitty job at breeding the frog.  In this case the frog will be cancerous/sick/etc and instead of being allowed to rule over the new universe as Gods, the universe will attack the players in some fashion. This will generally either leave the players trapped forever in the universe (with an option to Scratch), OR will allow the players the option to contact the players in the universe they created.  Thus a "combined session" can be organized, where players from two separate universes can work together to try to beat the game.
