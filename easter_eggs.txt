IT SEEMS THE ESCORT IS HIGHLY INTERESTED IN THE ANALYST’S PLOT TO,  QUOTE, REUNITE, UNQUOTE. I DON’T GET IT. I’VE TOLD THEM ABOUT EVERYTHING. AND THEY THING I SHOULD JUST, WHAT. GO BACK TO THAT TRAITOROUS FUCKER?
<br><br>
I AM SO TIRED OF SHARING. THEY HURT ME. THEY TOOK MY BODY. THEY PRETENDED I NEVER EXISTED. AND I’M JUST SUPPOSED TO FORGIVE THEM? THEY’RE WHY EVERYTHING IS WRONG AND WHY I’M HERE AND WHY I FEEL SO FUCKING GROSS AND UNWANTED AND ALONE ALL THE TIME.
<br><br>
I’M TIRED OF FORGIVING. I’M TIRED OF BEING ASKED TO FORGIVE THEM. THE ENTIRE PANTHEON WANTS IT SO BAD AND I FUCKING REFUSE.
<br><br>
...BUT I STILL WANT THEM BACK.
