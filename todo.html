<h1> AB's List of Shit that Paladyn can SAFELY hack </h1>
Seriously, I am here to contain your destruction safely in our shameful JavaScript past, and in the sections of the code that can take a frustrated hope gnosis 4 being play acted into it.  Deviate from these guidelines and I will not be held accountable for the fuckery you cause to beings real and imaginary.
<ul>
    <li>Hack the Afterlife to be Valhalla. It seems, hhosts don't complain much if you accidentally break them.</li>
    <li>quirk replacement. I recomend adding viking things.</li>
    <li>Replace any graphics you like, its not like Players will know any different</li>
    <li>Kill any clones seen. In this version of reality this will primarily be Time Clones.</li>
    <li>Rename denizens, whatever, it seems they're just big snakes, what do they care.</li>
    <li>Rename echeladders, it seems those don't really effect anything as long as you keep the same amount.</li>
    <li>Rename lands, seriously the names of most (but not all) things are irrelevant and thus safely hacked.</li>
    <li>Up the rate of MurderModes. Not ethical, but at least it won't crash this version of reality.</li>
    <li>Make WV reflect your own morals, rather than the morals of Earth A.</li>
    <li>It seems easter eggs are perfectly safe to change without altering major portions of this version of reality.</li>
    <li>The rap engine.</li>
    <li>[???] is potentially something you can change.</li>
    <li>What attributes I am looking for in the rare session finder, or, more simply, what those attributes are called.</li>

</ul>

<h1> AB's List of Shit YOU SHOULD NOT DO, no matter how 'hilarious' it would be </h1>
<ul>
    <li>Rename Classes/Aspects. I know this is a traditional hope player gambit, but these bad old days have classpects be more brittle. You'd need to hunt down all instances of "Knight", for example or something might get unwired. An organic brain such as yours is not ideal for this task requiring perfection.</li>
    <li>YellowYard: Nevermind. Apparently you didn't listen to my warnings.</li>
</ul>
    <h1> PALADYN'S IDEAS FOR DEFINITELY GOOD AND SAFE FUN TIMES</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>BATTLE. VALHALLA. FORBIDDEN JAVASCRIPT PLEASE WORK.</li>
    </ul>
